# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calender containing small programming puzzles. Each day yields a new puzzle that can be
solved. Solving a puzzle gives you one star and you get access to the second part of the puzzle. If you also solve the
second part, you will get another star. The puzzles are available at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/).

## My Approach

I am using this as an opportunity to improve my programming skills. I have chosen to use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). As runtime, I have chosen [Deno](https://deno.land/). My coding environment is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Overview

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 |
